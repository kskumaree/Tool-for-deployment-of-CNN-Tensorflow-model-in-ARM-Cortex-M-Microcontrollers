# MicroQuantization-Tool
Automated Inference Code Generation for ARM Microcontrollers
Follow the manual uploaded to get the procedure on deploying Neural Networks in Microcontroller
Works for Neural Networks With
1. Convolution layer
2. Maxpooling layer
3. ReLu and Softmax Activation
4. Fully connected layer
Two examples for quantization (OCR and sine model) has also been uploaded for reference
