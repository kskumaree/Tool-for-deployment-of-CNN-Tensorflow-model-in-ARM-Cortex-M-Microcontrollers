# MicroQuantization-Tool
Implementation of an open-source framework that automatically generates inference 
code from trained CNN models which can then be readily deployed on ARM 
Microcontrollers.


Follow the manual uploaded to get the procedure on deploying Neural Networks in Microcontroller
Works for Neural Networks With
1. Convolution layer
2. Maxpooling layer
3. ReLu and Softmax Activation
4. Fully connected layer
Two examples for quantization (OCR and sine model) has also been uploaded for reference
